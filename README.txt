To run the program you must use command line arguments. Where the first argument is the vm.c file and the second is the text document with assembly code instructions formatted as below.

Text File Example:
7 0 45
7 0 6
6 0 4
1 0 4
1 0 3
(Note that the text file must contain only integers separated by spaces, and the total number of integers must be divisible by 3)

To compile the code type gcc vm.c into the command line and hit enter. Then to run, type ./a.out followed by a space and the name of the assembly code text document as seen below.
	Example:  $ gcc vm.c
		     $ ./a.out input.txt
